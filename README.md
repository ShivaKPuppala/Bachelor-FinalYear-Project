## 🧩 Project Overview
**EcoMachining** is an academic research project focused on developing and testing **biodegradable cutting fluids** made from **coconut oil (CC)** and **sunflower oil (SF)** blended with **maize starch additives (MSA)**.  
The goal was to compare these **eco-friendly formulations** against conventional fluids during **turning of EN8 steel under Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL)** and analyze their thermal and tribological performance.
