### *Performance Assessment of Additive-Based Vegetable Oils as Cutting Fluids in Machining*

This project explores the formulation and application of **biodegradable cutting fluids** derived from **coconut oil and sunflower oil** blended with **maize starch additives**. It compares their cooling, lubricating, and tribological properties against conventional fluids during **EN8 steel machining under Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL)**.

---

## 🧪 Objective
To evaluate the machining performance of vegetable oil–based cutting fluids enhanced with maize starch additives in terms of:
- Thermal conductivity
- Cutting temperature
- Tool wear
- Surface roughness

## ⚙️ Experiment Setup
| Parameter | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| Work Material | EN8 Steel |
| Machine | PSG-124 Lathe |
| Operation | Turning |
| Tool | CNMG120408NC6110 Carbide |
| Feed | 0.17 mm/rev |
| Speed | 560 rpm |
| Depth of Cut | 0.5 mm |
| Flow Rate | 10 ml/min (MQL) |

## 🧫 Cutting Fluid Formulations
| Base Oil | Additive (Maize Starch) | Concentration |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Coconut Oil | 0.1g, 0.5g, 1.0g per 100ml | |
| Sunflower Oil | 0.1g, 0.25g, 0.5g per 100ml | |

All fluids were **ultrasonically homogenized** to ensure uniform dispersion and stability.

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Coconut Oil + 0.1g starch per 100ml** provided **best performance** in reducing cutting temperature and tool wear.
- **Sunflower Oil variants** showed superior **surface finish** due to better lubricity.
- All bio-fluids demonstrated **higher thermal conductivity** than pure oils, validating their **eco-friendly efficiency**.

---

## 🌍 Sustainability Impact
The study supports **green manufacturing** initiatives by reducing:
- Toxic emissions
- Operator health hazards
- Non-biodegradable waste

The results suggest a feasible replacement for mineral-based cutting fluids with **renewable, plant-derived alternatives**.
